# Make the hideous 'safe' install for MySQL.Remember Debian people make  the root MariaDB user 
# to authenticate using the unix_socket plugin by default rather than with a password.
# Setting a password here is useless. For more info visit the following links:

# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/differences-in-mariadb-in-debian-and-ubuntu/
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/authentication-plugin-unix-socket/
# Crucial to understand this situation on Debian installs: 
# The unix_socket authentication plugin allows the user to use operating system credentials 
# when connecting to MariaDB via the local Unix socket file. This Unix socket file is defined by the socket system variable.
# This basically means the root user from the system is the one able to log in as root into the MariaDB.
